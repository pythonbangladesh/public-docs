# Python Bangladesh Sub-Domain Program

[Python Bangladesh Organization](https://pythonbd.org/) is introducing a **Sub-Domain Program** to support and connect **like-minded tech communities** across Bangladesh, including (but not limited to) Django, AI/ML, Data Science, and university-based groups.

## 🎯 Program Objective

The goal of this initiative is to build a **collaborative ecosystem** where independent communities can come together under the Python Bangladesh umbrella to:

- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing  
- Co-organize workshops, meetups, events, and conferences  
- Strengthen the overall Python and open-source ecosystem in Bangladesh  

## 🌱 Community Values

Python Bangladesh follows the philosophy of the **[Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/)** and promotes:

- Open Source  
- Open Access  
- Community-driven growth  

To align with these principles, participating communities must be **non-commercial and/or non-profit** in nature.

## 🌐 Sub-Domain Support

Approved communities will receive a dedicated sub-domain under `pythonbd.org`, for example:

- `ruet.pythonbd.org`  
- `aimlcommunity.pythonbd.org`  

These sub-domains are intended to provide visibility, credibility, and a shared identity within the national Python community.

- Email addresses of **two primary contact persons**

- Brief technical requirements (if any)
