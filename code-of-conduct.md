# Python Bangladesh Code of Conduct

Python Bangladesh is made up of members from all divisions of Bangladesh with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great success and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help guide your interactions and keep Python a positive, successful, and inclusive space.

## Our Community

Members of the Python Bangladesh community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment and include:

* **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaborationâ€”whether itâ€™s on code, ideas, events, or other contributions.  
* **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We respect the processes set forth in the community and work within them.  
* **Acknowledging time and effort.** We recognize the volunteer contributions that sustain the Python community and are thoughtful when addressing the work of others.  
* **Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences.** We welcome constructive feedback and value the diverse experiences that others bring.  
* **Showing empathy toward other community members.** We communicate thoughtfully, whether online or in person, and remain tactful when facing differing views.  
* **Being considerate.** We are mindful of the needs and experiences of our peers in the Python community.  
* **Being respectful.** We respect others' time, skills, perspectives, and contributions.  
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When disagreements arise, we engage respectfully and courteously.  
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We welcome everyone who wants to participate and foster an environment where all individuals feel safe and valued.

## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. Python Bangladesh is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.
