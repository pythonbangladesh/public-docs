# Python Bangladesh: Inter-Community Collaboration & Growth Framework

This document outlines the shared vision, principles, and collaboration areas between **Python Bangladesh** and **like-minded technology communities**.  
It serves as a mutual understanding to foster long-term collaboration, sustainability, and collective growth within the Python and open-source ecosystem in Bangladesh.

This is **not a legal contract**, but a community-driven framework based on trust, transparency, and shared values.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this framework is to:

- Connect independent tech communities under a shared national umbrella  
- Encourage collaboration rather than isolation  
- Enable shared learning, resources, and infrastructure  
- Strengthen the overall Python and open-source ecosystem in Bangladesh  

---

## 🌱 Shared Values

All collaborating communities are expected to align with the core values inspired by the **Python Software Foundation (PSF)**:

- Open Source and Open Knowledge  
- Open Access and inclusivity  
- Community-led, volunteer-driven growth  
- Respectful, harassment-free environments  

---

## 🤝 Areas of Collaboration

Collaboration between Python Bangladesh and partner communities may include, but is not limited to, the following areas.

### 1️⃣ Events and Knowledge Sharing
- Joint workshops, meetups, and study groups  
- Co-hosted conferences or regional events  
- Speaker and mentor sharing across communities  

### 2️⃣ Online Community Support
- Shared access to **premium online meeting platforms** (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom) for:
  - Community meetups  
  - Workshops  
  - Panel discussions  
- Coordination support for online event logistics

> Access to shared tools will be based on availability and mutual agreement.

### 3️⃣ Sub-Domain & Infrastructure Support
- Eligible communities may receive a dedicated sub-domain under `pythonbd.org`
- Sub-domains are intended for:
  - Community websites  
  - Event pages  
  - Documentation or learning resources  

Infrastructure support is provided to improve visibility, credibility, and discoverability.

### 4️⃣ Cross-Community Promotion
- Mutual promotion of events and initiatives  
- Highlighting partner communities on official Python Bangladesh channels  
- Encouraging participation across community boundaries  

---

## 🧭 Autonomy & Responsibilities

- Each community remains **independent and self-governed**
- Python Bangladesh does **not interfere** in internal leadership or decision-making
- Communities are responsible for:
  - Their content and activities  
  - Maintaining respectful conduct  
  - Keeping shared resources used responsibly  

---

## 🛡 Code of Conduct Alignment

All collaborating communities must maintain a **Code of Conduct** aligned with the  
**Python Bangladesh Code of Conduct**:

https://github.com/pythonbangladesh/public-docs/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md

This ensures a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment across all shared activities.

---

## 🔄 Review & Continuity

- Collaboration may be reviewed periodically to ensure alignment with shared values
- Either party may step back from collaboration if:
  - Community values diverge  
  - Shared resources are misused  
  - The community becomes inactive or commercial  

Such decisions should be handled transparently and respectfully.

---

## 🌍 Vision Forward

Python Bangladesh believes that **strong ecosystems are built through collaboration**, not competition.  
This framework exists to help communities grow together, learn from one another, and build a sustainable future for Python and open-source technologies in Bangladesh.
